            <p>With respect to information submitted or collected on the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension, you accept Divya Gupta’s
                privacy policy as set forth in this document. This does not pertain to, and Divya Gupta is not responsible
                for the privacy practices of, any third-party websites to which the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension hyperlinks. Certain
                areas of the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension may be subject to additional privacy-related provisions, links
                to which will be posted in those areas.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Activity Logging. </span>When You use the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension, which may be hosted in
                part
                or its entirety by a third party,
                the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension will collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use
                of “cookies” or Your “IP address”)
                about Your activities. Divya Gupta uses this activity information (the “Activity Information”) for internal
                purposes such as to administer the
                Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension, improve the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension, and help us understand how the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension is being used
                including the demographics and
                “clickstreams” of its visitors. “Cookies” are small pieces of information stored on Your hard drive,
                not on the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension.
                You are always free to decline cookies if Your browser permits, but in that case, some portions of the
                Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension may not operate properly.
                An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Personally Identifiable Information.</span> The Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension is designed so that
                You may
                generally browse it without providing any Personally Identifiable Information (defined below).
                Certain areas of the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension, however, may require or allow the voluntarily submission of
                Personally
                Identifiable Information (for example, registration to receive Divya Gupta publications). Divya Gupta uses Your
                Personally
                Identifiable Information for the purposes for which it was submitted by You to Divya Gupta and for Divya Gupta to
                send you publications
                and invitations that may be of interest to you. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Removal of Personally Identifiable Information.</span> Divya Gupta will use reasonable
                efforts to remove
                Your Personally Identifiable Information from our then current Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension at any time upon
                Your written request to <a href="mailto:divya261261@gmail.com">divya261261@gmail.com</a>. Such removal of
                Personally Identifiable Information
                will not ensure the permanent removal of such Personally Identifiable Information from the Divya Gupta
                website.
                For example, such Personally Identifiable Information may remain in our archival or backup copies of
                the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Additional Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information.</span> We may share
                Personally
                Identifiable Information with third parties, including affiliated firms and third parties performing
                services for or on behalf of Divya Gupta. Such services may include communications, database, event
                management,
                hosting, mailing, and marketing services. Additionally, we cannot fully ensure that Your Personally
                Identifiable
                Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to
                disclose
                information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may
                circumvent our
                security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or an
                error may
                occur in the administration of the Swiggy Companion Chrome Extension. In the unlikely event that Divya Gupta needs to
                investigate or
                resolve possible problems or inquiries, we may, and You authorize us to, disclose any information about
                You to
                government officials as permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Miscellaneous Privacy Terms.</span> We’ve implemented and follow appropriate
                technical measures to
                protect against the risks of unauthorized access to, erroneous disclosure of, and unlawful interception
                of Personally
                Identifiable Information. You should know, however, that we cannot fully eliminate such risks.
